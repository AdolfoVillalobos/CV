\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}

I am an engineer with a strong background in mathematics, probability, statistics and computer science. 
I am interested in problems of uncertainty and risk, and building systems that learn effectively from data. 
My goal is to build cool products that allow me to explore those interests.  I am also a creative individual. I love great music and literature (I sing and play guitar). 
The things that I most value are learning, being challenged and working 
with talented people.

I also love both sports and competition.  I gather often to watch sport events with family and friends, mostly football games, but also endurance sports and the olympics.
I cried when Chile won its first Copa America against
 Argentina. I also dream to finish an Iron Man triathlon someday, since I love endurance sports. As for e-sports, I played League of Legends until recently, and was very familiar
 with the local Twitch scene (I have friends that became pro-players). I love watching live matches, and often stayed to late hours whenever the wold cup was being broadcasted. 
 I stopped playing LoL when I was in university to focus on my studies, but still continued to play less-demanding competitive games. 

\lettersection{Why Coolbet?}

I just love your culture and product. You encourage people to be themselves, to work hard and be the best, but
also have fun and have balance. I would feel at home. 
Also, your product is amazing to me, since I haven't seen anything like it in the region. 
I think the job position combines most of the things I love: 
Dealing with Uncertainty, technology, sports, competition and data. I would be thrilled to join you and help you succeed. Frankly would do it for free just to be a part of it. 

\lettersection{Why Me?}

I am smart, driven and a team player. I have the skills and knowledge required to face the technical challenges, and the ability to
adapt, learn and succeed under any obstacle.  I am already in love with the product, and I think that my experience with the local sport scene can be of value.
I you consider me, be sure that I consider the possibility of working with you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I will give my best to help you grow.
