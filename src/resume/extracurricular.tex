  {}{
   I worked on several DL projects: from image recognition, architechture understanding (CNN, RNN and GANS)
   to NLP tasks (text summarization and text translation). The code is available in my GitHub: \url{https://github.com/AdolfoVillalobos/Courses_PUC/tree/main/PUC_deep_learning.}
   I used Keras and Pytorch.

  \cventry{DebtControl Bots}{}{}{}{
    A software project focused on the automatization of certain human activites
    related with payment notification. The project was developed for DebtControl,
    a chilean company dedicated to loan servicing. We used Python web-scrapping tools, and
    a raspbery-pi to exectute the code.
